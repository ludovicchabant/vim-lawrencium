=============================================================================
1.  Introduction                                *lawrencium-intro*

When a file from a Mercurial repository is open in a buffer, that buffer gets
new commands defined.

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

=============================================================================
2.  Commands                                    *lawrencium-commands*

All commands defined by |lawrencium| are local to each buffer.

                                                *:Hg*
:Hg {args}              Run an arbitrary Mercurial command. Similar to :!hg
                        [args] but the '--repository' is automatically
                        specified with the root of the repository the current
                        file belongs to, and it will auto-complete any
                        standard command or option.
                        
                        Also, unless the |lawrencium_auto_cd| global is set to
                        `0`, it will temporarily set the current directory to be
                        the root of the repository so that auto-completed
                        filenames work out of the box.

                                                *:Hg!*
:Hg! {args}             Like |:Hg|, but the output of the command is placed in
                        a temp file and edited in a split window.

                        Once the output is open in a buffer, Lawrencium will
                        try to set the file type according to the Mercurial
                        command that was run. See |lawrencium_hg_commands_file_types|.

                                                *:Hgcd*
:Hgcd[!] {path}         |:cd| relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hglcd*
:Hglcd[!] {path}        |:lcd| relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgedit*
:Hgedit {file}          |:edit| {file} relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgedit!*
:Hgedit! {file}         |:edit!| {file} relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgstatus*
:Hgstatus               Shows the output of 'hg status' in a split window.
                        Some extra-commands, along with some default mappings,
                        are available in this window. See
                        |lawrencium-status-window|.

                                                *:Hgdiff*
:Hgdiff                 Diffs the current file against its parent revision.
                        This splits the current window to show both the
                        current file and the parent revision file, using Vim's
                        |diff| abilities.

                                                *:Hgdiff_f*
:Hgdiff {revspec}       Same as |:Hgdiff| but shows a diff of the current file
                        with the specified revision. Any revision number, hash
                        or spec that can be passed to `hg cat` is valid.

                                                *:Hgvdiff*
:Hgvdiff                Same as |:Hgdiff| but uses a vertical split instead of
                        a horizontal split.

                                                *:Hgvdiff_f*
:Hgvdiff {revspec}      Same as |:Hgdiff_f| but uses a vertical split.

                                                *:Hgdiffsum*
:Hgdiffsum              Shows the "diff summary" (the output of `hg diff`)
                        of the current file against its parent revision.

                                                *:Hgdiffsum_f*
:Hgdiffsum {revspec}    Same as |:Hgdiffsum| but shows a "diff summary" of the
                        current file with the specified revision. Any revision
                        number, hash or spec that can be passed to `hg diff`
                        is valid.

                                                *:Hgdiffsumsplit*
                                                *:Hgdiffsumsplit_f*
:Hgdiffsumsplit
:Hgdiffsumsplit {revspec}
                        Same as |:Hgdiffsum| and |:Hgdiffsum_f| respectively, 
                        but opens the diff summary in a split window instead
                        of the current window.

                                                *:Hgvdiffsumsplit*
                                                *:Hgvdiffsumsplit_f*
:Hgvdiffsumsplit
:Hgvdiffsumsplit {revspec}
                        Same as |:Hgdiffsumsplit| and |:Hgdiffsumsplit_f|
                        respectively, but uses a vertical split window instead
                        of a horizontal split window.

                                                *:Hgcommit*
:Hgcommit               Opens a new window to edit a commit message into a
                        temporary file and, upon quitting the buffer, if that
                        file has been written to, commit the current changes
                        to the repository.

                                                *:Hgvcommit*
:Hgvcommit              Same as |:Hgcommit| but uses a vertical split to edit
                        the commit message.

:Hgrevert {files}                               *:Hgrevert*
                        Reverts the given files (in repo-relative paths). If no
                        file are given, reverts the current file.

:Hgrevert! {files}                              *:Hgrevert!*
                        Same as |:Hgrevert| but with the --no-backup option
                        given to prevent a .orig backup file from being
                        created.

                                                *:Hglog*
:Hglog
                        Opens the history (log) for the current repository
                        in the |preview-window|. Some extra-commands, along with 
                        some default mappings, are available in this window.
                        See |lawrencium-log-window|.

                                                *:Hglog_f*
:Hglog {file}           Same as |:Hglog|, but opens the log for the specified
                        file or direcotry instead of the whole repository.

                                                *:Hglogthis*
:Hglogthis              Same as |:Hglog| but opens the history (log) for the
                        currently edited file instead of the whole repository.

                                                *:Hgannotate*
:Hgannotate             Splits the current window to show annotations in the
                        left window. These annotation are retrieved with `hg
                        annotate`.
                        If the current file has local edits, the full output
                        of `hg annotate` will be opened instead, which is the
                        annotated parent revision.
                        Some extra-commands, along with some default mappings,
                        are available in this window.
                        See |lawrencium-annotate-window|.


=============================================================================
3.  Status Window                               *lawrencium-status-window*

The `hg status` window opened by Lawrencium has a few special commands 
defined in it. Also, unless the global |lawrencium_define_mappings| is set to
`0`, some commands are mapped to keyboard shortcuts, as detailed in the
following descriptions.


                                                *:Hgstatusedit*
:Hgstatusedit           Open the file mentioned on the current line.
                        Mapped to <CR>.

                                                *:Hgstatusaddremove*
:Hgstatusaddremove      Run `hg addremove` on the file mentioned on the
                        current line, or on the lines currently selected in
                        visual selection mode (see |visual-start|).
                        Mapped to <CTRL-A>.

                                                *:Hgstatusdiff*
:Hgstatusdiff           Open a diff window on the file mentioned on the
                        current line, between the working directory version
                        and the parent revision version. Similar to running
                        |:Hgdiff| on that file.
                        Mapped to <CTRL-D>.

                                                *:Hgstatusvdiff*
:Hgstatusvdiff          Similar to |:Hgstatusdiff|, but use a vertical split.
                        Similar to running |:Hgvdiff| on that file.
                        Mapped to <CTRL-V>.

                                                *:Hgstatusdiffsum*
:Hgstatusdiffsum        Similar to |:Hgstatusdiff|, but show a diff summary,
                        like the one shown with |:Hgdiffsum|, instead of
                        running a full Vim diff.
                        Mapped to <CTRL-U>.

                                                *:Hgstatusvdiffsum*
:Hgstatusvdiffsum       Similar to |:Hgstatusdiffsum|, but use a vertical
                        split.
                        Mapped to <CTRL-H>.

                                                *:Hgstatuscommit*
:Hgstatuscommit         Runs |:Hgcommit| on the files currently mentioned in
                        the buffer, or in the current selection. The first 
                        option means you can delete lines from the buffer
                        until the remaining filenames are those you want to
                        commit.
                        Mapped to <CTRL-S>.

                                                *:Hgstatusvcommit*
:Hgstatusvcommit        Similar to |:Hgstatuscommit|, but use a vertical
                        split, as with |:Hgvcommit|.
                        Not mapped byd default.

                                                *:Hgstatusrefresh*
:Hgstatusrefresh        Refreshes the status window by running `hg status`
                        again.
                        Mapped to <CTRL-R>.

                                                *:Hgstatusqnew*
:Hgstatusqnew {patch} {message}.
                        If you have the 'mq' extension enabled, creates a new
                        patch with the file currently mentioned in the buffer,
                        or in the current selection. You must give a patch name,
                        and may optionally write a commit message for the patch
                        (without surrounding quotes).

                                                *:Hgstatusqrefresh*
:Hgstatusqrefresh       If you have the 'mq' extension enabled, refreshes the
                        current patch with the files currently mentioned in the
                        buffer, or in the current selection.

                                                *lawrencium-status-mappings*
A few other mappings are available in the status window:

   <C-N>                Jump to the next filename.
   <C-P>                Jump to the previous filename.
   q                    Quit the status window.



=============================================================================
4.  Log Window                                  *lawrencium-log-window*
                        
The `hg log` window opened by Lawrencium has a few special commands 
defined in it. Also, unless the global |lawrencium_define_mappings| is set to
`0`, some commands are mapped to keyboard shortcuts, as detailed in the
following descriptions.

                                                *:Hglogrevedit*
:Hglogrevedit           Looks at the revision specified on the current line,
                        and opens that revision for edit in the previous
                        window (although as a read-only buffer).
                        This is only valid if the logged path maps to a file
                        (i.e. not a directory, and not the whole repository as
                        with |:Hglog|).
                        Mapped to |<C-E>|.

                                                *:Hglogdiff*
:Hglogdiff              Looks at the revision specified on the current line,
                        and runs an `hg diff` between that revision and the
                        previously listed revision (in the line below). It
                        opens that diff in the previous window.
                        It doesn't do anything if the cursor is on the last
                        line.
                        Mapped to |<CR>|.

                                                *:Hglogdiff_r*
:Hglogdiff {rev}        Same as |:Hglogdiff|, but opens a diff between the
                        specified revision and the working directory.

                                                *:Hglogdiff_r_r*
:Hglogdiff {rev1} {rev2}
                        Same as |:Hglogdiff|, but opens a diff between the
                        two specified revisions.

                                                *lawrencium-log-mappings*
A few other mappings are available in the log window:

    q                   Quit the log window.



=============================================================================
5.  Annotate Window                             *lawrencium-annotate-window*

The following commands are available in a |:Hgannotate| window along with the
specified keyboard mappings, unless the |lawrencium_define_mappings| setting
is set to `0`.

                                                *Hgannotatediffsum*
:Hgannotatediffsum      Show a diff summary (similar to |:Hgdiffsum|) for the
                        revision mentioned under the cursor.
                        Mapped to |<CR>|.



=============================================================================
6.  Global Settings                             *lawrencium-global-settings*

The following global settings can be defined in your |vimrc| to change the
default behaviour of Lawrencium.

                                                *lawrencium_hg_executable*
g:lawrencium_hg_executable
                        Defines the executable to run when running Mercurial
                        commands.
                        Defaults to simply `hg`.

                                                *lawrencium_auto_cd*
g:lawrencium_auto_cd    Specifies whether the current working directory should 
                        be set to the repository's root while running |:Hg|
                        commands so that auto-completion works magically with
                        repository relative paths.
                        Defaults to `1`.

                                                *lawrencium_define_mappings*
g:lawrencium_define_mappings
                        Specifies whether Lawrencium should define default
                        keyboard shortcuts.
                        Defaults to `1`.

                                                *lawrencium_hg_commands_file_types*
g:lawrencium_hg_commands_file_types
                        Defines the |file-types| that Lawrencium should use
                        when editing the output of |:Hg!| based on the
                        Mercurial command that was used.
                        
                        By default, unless overridden, the following commands
                        map to the following file types:

                        diff                diff
                        graphlog            graphlog

                                                *lawrencium_annotate_width_offset*
g:lawrencium_annotate_width_offset
                        Specifies the offset to use when computing the width
                        of the annotations window (opened with |:Hgannotate|).
                        Defaults to 0.
                        This is useful for example if you have |'listchars'|
                        set to display characters at the window border when
                        unwrapped lines are extending outside.

                                                *lawrencium_auto_close_buffers*
g:lawrencium_auto_close_buffers
                        Specifies whether to auto-close buffers opened by
                        Lawrencium. For instance, any diff summary buffer open
                        by `Hglog` will be deleted when the log window
                        disappears.
